# TRESPASSING AND THEFT DETECTION
In this project, I'll using YOLOv7 pose to detect trespassing and thief. 
It just recognize a pose of human from video and notice it to the screen.
Because of my skill about using github so there are only main code and training code of model using in main code. Sorry about that.
